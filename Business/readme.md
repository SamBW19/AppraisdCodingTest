﻿# Appraisd coding test

For this test you are asked to expand the functionality of `AppraisalController.Add`, and to add test code coverage for your expansion.  You should probably do TDD.

## The new requirement
A new setting has been added to the system - OnlySuperAdminsCanAddAppraisals.  You need to update the AppraisalController so that when this setting is set as `true` only users with the flag `IsSuperAdmin` will be allowed to add new appraisals.  

If a user tries to add an appraisal but is not a super admin then they should receive a `JsonDummyResult` with `IsSucces` as false and an appropriate error message and the database should not be changed.

The new behaviour should be as follows

| User.IsAdmin | User.IsSuperAdmin | Settings.OnlySuperAdminsCanAddAppraisals | Appraisal Is Added? |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|  true        |  true             |          true                            |    true             |
|  false       |  true             |          true                            |    true             |
|  true        |  false            |          true                            |    false            |
|  false       |  false            |          true                            |    false            |
|  true        |  true             |          false                           |    true             |
|  false       |  true             |          false                           |    false            |
|  true        |  false            |          false                           |    true             |
|  false       |  false            |          false                           |    false            |
